# DNA 2.0
#### A puzzle created by Zach Blick for Adventures in Algorithms at Menlo School in Atherton, CA

## Your goal
Complete the function, STRCount(), to return longest consecutive run of a STR in a DNA sequence.

The function header is in the DNA java file. Write your code there.

A tester file has been provided for you. It utilizes junit tests.
To use this test file, run either the entire thing or individual tests (one at a time).
Some of the tests use very, very large DNA sequences — tens of millions or billions of base pairs in length.
