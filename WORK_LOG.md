| Oct 16   | 115-145pm   | I began thinking about how to approach the problem. Seems like a dp problem to count all the consecutive sequences O(n)?, but brute force solution is to iterate through the entire sequence and look for repeating, consecutive sequences of STR O(n^2) using 2 loops.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Oct 17   |   9-930pm   | I began writing code to implement a more straightforward approach to the problem to get a baseline performance. This approach should iterate through the entire length of the sequence with a for loop, and then within the for loop use some sort of loop to count the consecutive STRs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Oct 18   |  930-10pm   | I debugged the code to implement the straightforward approach. I corrected the logic in my if statements and while loop. The initial attempt does not pass the tricky test case, returning 3 instead of 4. The outer for loop was undercounting since I iterated i in the inner loop, skipping overlaps/repeats, so I created a local variable j that is incremented within the for and while loop to avoid the overcounting issue. However, the O(n^2) approach causes the largest testcase to take 48+ minutes. |
| Oct 18   | 1045-1115pm | Brainstorm more about not dp approach. Could use some sort of boolean to set for like str sequence to be an index to go back to?? weird implementation only ends up working for largest test case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
