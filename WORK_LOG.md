| Oct 16 |  115-145pm  | I began thinking about how to approach the problem. Seems like a dp problem to count all the consecutive sequences O(n)?, but brute force solution is to iterate through the entire sequence and look for repeating, consecutive sequences of STR O(n^2) using 2 loops.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Oct 17 |   9-930pm   | I began writing code to implement a more straightforward approach to the problem to get a baseline performance. This approach should iterate through the entire length of the sequence with a for loop, and then within the for loop use some sort of loop to count the consecutive STRs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Oct 18 |  930-10pm   | I debugged the code to implement the straightforward approach. I corrected the logic in my if statements and while loop. The initial attempt does not pass the tricky test case, returning 3 instead of 4. The outer for loop was undercounting since I iterated i in the inner loop, skipping overlaps/repeats, so I created a local variable j that is incremented within the for and while loop to avoid the overcounting issue. However, the O(n^2) approach causes the largest testcase to take 48+ minutes. |
| Oct 18 | 1045-1115pm | Brainstorm more about not dp approach. Could use some sort of boolean to set for like str sequence to be an index to go back to?? weird implementation only ends up working for largest test case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Oct 19 |  730-830pm  | I reviewed dp on geeksforgeeks. Then, I implemented and debugged my dp approach to this problem. I iterate backwards and check if an STR sequence starts at index i of the for loop, and increment the dp array by 1 if a str is found in front of another in consecutive sequence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Oct 22 |  915-10am   | I began implementing the rabin karp fingerprint algorithm and horner's method with a monte carlo algorithm. I feel like the Las Vegas algorithm is more reliable but not worth all the extra time to check for the 1 in a very big number chance of a potential collision. I began coding based off the pseudocode on the slides.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Oct 23 |   230-3pm   | Debugging index out of bound error and overall algorithm approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Oct 27 |    2-3pm    | Scrapped my past work to restart because I was confused by index out of bounds error i kept on getting. I was not iterating through the sequence of DNA correctly. I reimplemented the rabin karp algorithm and made sure that the loops covered the entire scope of the array, not missing the edge.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Oct 27 |   5-530pm   | Resolve the tricky edge case. Returned 3 instead of 4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
